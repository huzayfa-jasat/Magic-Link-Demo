Excellent. With this in mind, please create an implementation plan markdown file. Add the overall goals/topics/context references at the top. Then, at the bottom, create a list of SUBTASKS.

This list of subtasks will be MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE and COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE. This means each task is completely separate from ther subtasks and does not rely on other subtasks (split this up by FILE so that we are not overwriting files in various subtasks if they work in parallel). COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE means that, by the time all subtasks finish, there are no other tasks to do to finish the implementation plan.

I do not need (in the subtasks list) subtasks related to testing. ONLY development for now.

We will be running all of the subtasks at once, in parallel Claude Code jobs. So again, make sure the file is set up in a way that each subtask operates on its own file, and has the needed context and understanding of the job to ensure completion
