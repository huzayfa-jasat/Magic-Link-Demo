# Bouncer Batch Progress Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented progress tracking for deliverable batches that shows real-time processing status based on the bouncer API's `processed` field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes
- **File**: `db/add_processed_column.sql`
- Added `processed` column to `Bouncer_Batches_Deliverable` table to track the number of emails already processed by the bouncer API
- Added index for efficient progress queries

### 2. Bouncer API Updates
- **File**: `backend/external_apis/bouncer.js`
- Modified `checkDeliverabilityBatch()` to return both completion status and processed count
- Changed return type from boolean to object: `{isCompleted: boolean, processed: number}`

### 3. Status Checker Worker Updates
- **File**: `backend/queue/workers/status_checker_worker.js`
- Updated to handle the new response format from bouncer API
- Added call to `db_updateBouncerBatchProcessed()` to save processed count in database
- Enhanced logging to show processed count during status checks

### 4. Queue Database Functions
- **File**: `backend/queue/funs_db.js`
- Added `db_updateBouncerBatchProcessed()` function to update the processed count in the database

### 5. Batch Routes
- **File**: `backend/routes/batches/routes.js`
- Added new route: `GET /:checkType/batch/:batchId/progress` for retrieving batch progress

### 6. Batch Controller
- **File**: `backend/routes/batches/controller.js`
- Added `getBatchProgress()` controller function
- Returns progress percentage, processed count, total emails, and cached results count
- Only supports deliverable batches (returns 100% for other types)

### 7. Batch Database Functions
- **File**: `backend/routes/batches/funs_db.js`
- Added `db_getBatchProgress()` function to calculate batch progress
- Progress calculation formula: `(processed_from_bouncer + cached_results) / total_emails * 100`
- Progress is capped at 99% until batch is marked completed
- Updated `db_getBatchesList()` to include progress field for deliverable batches that are processing

## API Response Format

### Progress Endpoint Response
```json
{
  "progress": 45,        // Percentage (0-100)
  "processed": 4500,     // Total processed (including cached)
  "total": 10000,        // Total emails in batch
  "cached_results": 500  // Number of cached results used
}
```

### Batch List Enhancement
Deliverable batches in processing state now include a `progress` field showing the completion percentage.

## Notes
- Progress tracking is only available for deliverable batches (not catchall)
- The `processed` field is updated each time the status checker runs
- Progress includes both newly processed emails and cached results
- Progress is capped at 99% until the batch is officially marked as completed to avoid confusion
