# Changes Summary: Display Batch Names in Credits Activity

## Overview
Updated the credits activity list to display batch names instead of generic "Verified Emails" text and filter out zero credit usage entries.

## Database Changes

### 1. Migration Script
Created migration script at `db/migrations/add_batch_tracking_to_credits.sql` that adds:
- `batch_id` column to `Users_Credit_Balance_History` table
- `batch_type` column to distinguish between deliverable/catchall batches
- Similar columns to `Users_Catchall_Credit_Balance_History` table
- Indexes for efficient lookups

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Updated Credit Deduction
- Modified `db_deductCreditsForActualBatch` in `backend/routes/batches/funs_db.js` to include batch_id and batch_type when creating credit history records

#### Updated History Queries
- Modified `db_getCreditBalanceHistory` in `backend/routes/credits/funs_db.js` to:
  - JOIN with batch tables to retrieve batch names
  - Filter out zero credit usage records
  - Return batch_name field for usage events

- Modified `db_getCatchallCreditBalanceHistory` in `backend/routes/catchall-credits/funs_db.js` with same changes

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### API Layer
- Added `listCatchallTransactions` function to `frontend/src/api/credits.js`

#### Controller
- Updated `frontend/src/app/Credits/Controller.jsx` to:
  - Fetch both regular and catchall credit histories
  - Combine them into a single transaction list

#### UI Component
- Updated `frontend/src/app/Credits/components/TransactionCard.jsx` to:
  - Accept batch_name parameter in `getEventTitle` function
  - Display batch name for usage events (falls back to "Verified Emails" if no batch name)

## Implementation Notes

1. The changes are backward compatible - historical records without batch_id will still display as "Verified Emails"
2. Zero credit usage records are now filtered out at the backend level
3. Both deliverable and catchall credit histories are combined in the frontend
4. The batch name is displayed prominently in the activity list for better user context

## Testing
After applying the database migration, test by:
1. Running a new batch verification
2. Checking the credits activity page to see batch names
3. Verifying that zero credit entries don't appear
4. Confirming both email validation and catchall validation credits show up
